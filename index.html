    <p>The 1983 Bollywood action-drama film Coolie is centered on the life of Iqbal (played by Amitabh Bachchan), 
        who is separated from his mother, Salma (Waheeda Rehman), and brother during a devastating flood. The tragedy was 
        orchestrated by the malicious Zafar Khan (Kader Khan). As an adult, Iqbal becomes the leader of the railway porters,
        or "coolies," and fights for their rights. The plot follows a classic "lost and found" narrative, as Iqbal's path 
        eventually crosses with his long-lost family members. The story also famously includes a near-fatal on-set injury to
        Bachchan, which resulted in a modified ending where his character survives.</p>
